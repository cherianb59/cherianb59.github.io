## Solving the housing crisis

Most cities are undergoing a housing crisis at the moment. Rents and house prices are increasing, much faster than people's wages. Most governments respond to this with the following measures

-- Freeze rents

-- Tax on investment properties

-- First home buyers payments

These policies subsidise demand, or disincentivise increasing supply. What needs to happen is to build more housing.

-- Remove heritage laws. If you like old buildings, then buy them. Don't impose restriction on other peope because you like the charcter and feel of a bygone era. Alternatively move to some country town where they havent updated the buildings. Why haven't they updated them? becuase no one wants to live there. 

-- Rezone areas around cities for higher density. THis provides more housing where people want to live.

-- Remove stamp duty and introduce land tax. Stamp duty stops people from moving houses, it increases the hurdle of buying a house to upsize or downsize into. People end up living in housing not suitable for their needs. A land tax creates the incentive to  better use land.  Land tax is also a wealth tax, people who have large or expensive land . You can't hide land, you can't move it offshore. A land tax stops land speculation, people can't just sit on a piece of land without consqeuence. Land taxes are on the unimproved value of the land, not the property values, this means that if you improve the land you get all the benefits. But if the land value improves, e.g there is more public transport or a hospital is built nearby, the tax increases. This is fair as the land ownder didn't build the hospital or the public transport, they shjouldnt get the gains.


-- Increase immigration for skilled trades. Labour is a principal cost in house building, and with low unemployment there is more jobs than people available to work. Increasing immigration for skilled trades lowers the cost of building new homes.
