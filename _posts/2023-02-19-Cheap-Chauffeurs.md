I like to play ultimate frisbee competitively, not many other do which means that competitive games have a small player base. Even though I live in the most popolous city in Australia, there are only around 10 teams in Sydney. 2 of these teams are made of the best players in Sydney, they have no realistic competition in Sydney, the closest equally skilled teams is in Newcastle (2 hours drive) or Canberra (3 hours drive).  
This means that frisbee tournaments are run over an entire Saturday, or weekend and are often over 100km away. Most people get to the tournament by driving, given the long distance it is cost effective to carpool. Typically in teams a driver puts their hand up to take passangers, and the passengers may reimburse the driver for fuel costs.

This seems fair, however it significantly underpays the driver, who not only incurs wear and tear to their car, but is also providing a service by driving. 
This article compares alternative modes of transport, how expensive they are and how inconvinient they are.
The conclusion is that passengers are getting an excellent service, very cheaply and that the driver is paying for it.  

Consider the return costs for two tournaments for a Sydney team,  one tournament is in Canberra (300km) and the other tournamnet is in Shepparton (700km and where the National competition was held in 2023).

### Uber ###

This is absurdly expensive, however this example is the closest alternative which replicates the convinence offered by driving and the effort from the driver driving their personal car the entire distance.

Sydney to Canberra: Total Cost $840, Per Person Cost $210, Time: 7 Hrs Convinience:10
Sydney to Shepparton: Total Cost $2,160, Per Person Cost $540, Time: 16 Hrs Convinience:10

### Public Transport ###

This is generally much cheaper but is impractical in most scenarios as public transport relies on high population density, while large fields used for tournaments are in low density areas. National competitions have typically been held in small towns with very little public transport. 

Public Transport also doesn't take you exactly to the accomadation or fields and adds to the time taken and inconvineince. 

Sydney to Canberra: Total Cost $85, Time: 9 Hrs Convinience: 5
The Murrays bus goes from Central station (or International airport, but this is even less convinient) to Civic in Canberra and takes 3.5 hours. The tournament fields are then another and cost around $2 but takes 30 minutes in bus/tram travel times and the frequency of the bus/tram is poor. It will take even longer if your accomodation isnt close to the fields.  

Sydney to Shepparton: Total Cost $200, Time: 9 Hrs 22 Hours 
You need to take a train from Central to Benalle station. It starts at 8:30 PM and arrives at 5:30 AM (9 hours) then take a 40 minutes bus to Shepparton station. 

### Hirecar ### 

This is similar to getting a driving, but separates the car costs from the driving cost.

A Corolla with unlimited kms is $90 per day.

Sydney to Canberra: Total Cost $340, Per person cost $85 ,  Time: 3.5 Hrs, Convinience: 8
Sydney to Canberra: Total Cost $500, Per person cost $125 , Time: 8 Hrs,   Convinience: 8

This is less convininet as you need to pick up and return the car
$270 3 days +  $70 (fuel)
$360 4 days +  $140 (fuel)

The per person costs are way more than the fuel money a driver has ever been given. The passengers are, virtually, free riders. 

### What should the driver get? ###

For sole traders the The ATO gives a deduction of $0.85 per km, this means for every km a sole trader drives for their bsuiness they get to deduct their income by $0.85. The purpose is account for the cost of running a car, the single rate covers all types of cars. I'm assuming frisbee players are a little more efficient and assume an expense of $0.36 per km. This covers the wear and tear and fuel costs, it doesn't cover the service of driving (which can be shared). $0.36 per km is easy to split in to 2,3,4 and 6  ($0.18, $0.12, $.09 $.06  per km ) depending on the number of passengers. 

This means Sydney to Canberra, (approximately 600km return) would cost $216 and a 4 person car pool means $54 each. An equivalent bus ride would cost $80 and only take you to the city centre (or airport). 

Sydney to Shepparton is 1400km return , a 4 person carpool means each person pays $126 each. 


Maybe that sounds like a lot to pay, but it is cheaper, quicker and more convininet than the alternatives. If you still feel like it's a lot that's because you are used to stiffing the driver and being cheap.  

If everyone takes turns driving, it's fair, but we all know that one person who cant drive. Dob them in and make sure they are doing their bit.
